## Why a license is important
Any creative work (including software) is automatically protected by copyright. Even when the software is available via code sharing platforms such as GitHub, no one can use it unless they are explicitly granted permission. This is done by adding a software license, which defines the set of rules and conditions for people who want to use the software. Finally, be aware that you, as the developer of a given piece of software, may not be a copyright owner of the code you write. Usually the copyright holder of a work is the employer (or hiring party) and not the author of the work.

## Getting started
We recommend you stick to one of the more popular licenses. Because these are typically written by lawyers, the license text is precise in expressing its terms. While that carries the unfortunate side effect of being difficult to understand, the widespread use of the more popular licenses means that there is a larger number of people who understand how the letter of the law should be interpreted.

Some commonly used licenses are the Apache-2.0 and MIT licenses. These permissive licenses have very few restrictions, allowing others to easily reuse your work. There are several websites that can help you choose a license:
- [choosealicense.com](choosealicense.com): helps to choose an open source license
- [tldrlegal.com](tldrlegal.com): summarizes what is allowed and not allowed under a given license


If you create a new repository on GitHub, you can automatically add a license to the repository. You can find instructions [on the GitHub help pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).

> ## Exercise
>
> Suppose you write code for a project at the university.
> Open sourcing software is not yet best practice in your community, and there is no clear standard software license to use.
> What license would you choose and why?
