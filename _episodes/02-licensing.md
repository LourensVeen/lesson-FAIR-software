## Why a license is important

Any creative work (including software) is automatically protected by copyright.
Even when the software is available via code sharing platforms such as GitHub,
no one can use it unless they are explicitly granted permission.
This is done by adding a software license, which defines the set of rules
and conditions for people who want to use the software.

Be aware that you, as the developer of a given piece of software,
may not be the copyright holder of the code you write. Often, the copyright
holder of the work is the employer (or hiring party) and not the author of the work.

## Choose a license

We recommend you use one of the more popular licenses. Because these
are typically written by lawyers, the license text is precise in expressing
its terms. While that carries the unfortunate side effect of being difficult
to understand, the widespread use of the more popular licenses means that
there is a larger number of people who understand how the letter of
the law should be interpreted.

Some commonly used licenses are the ``Apache-2.0`` and ``MIT`` licenses.
These permissive licenses have very few restrictions, allowing others to
easily reuse your work.

There are several websites that can help you choose a license:

- [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/): helps to choose an open-source license.
- [tldrlegal.com](https://tldrlegal.com/): summarizes what is allowed and not allowed under a given license.
